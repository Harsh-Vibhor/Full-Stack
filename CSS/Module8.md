📘 CSS Module 8 — Display & Positioning (Quick Notes)

📦 DISPLAY PROPERTY (controls element layout behavior)

1️⃣ block
• Takes full width
• Starts on new line
• Example elements: div, p, h1

2️⃣ inline
• Takes only required width
• Stays in same line
• Width/height cannot be applied
• Example: span, a

3️⃣ inline-block ⭐
• Stays in same line
• Allows width & height
• Used in buttons, nav items

4️⃣ none
• Hides element completely
• Removes it from layout

---

📍 POSITION PROPERTY (controls placement)

5️⃣ static (default)
• Normal document flow
• No positioning applied

6️⃣ relative
• Moves relative to its original position
• Space still reserved

7️⃣ absolute ⭐
• Positioned relative to nearest positioned parent
• Removed from normal flow
• Used for overlays, badges, dropdowns

8️⃣ fixed
• Fixed to viewport
• Does not move when scrolling
• Used for navbars, floating buttons

9️⃣ sticky
• Acts relative until scroll, then becomes fixed
• Used for sticky headers

---

🔝 Z-INDEX

• Controls stacking order of elements
• Higher value appears on top
• Works only on positioned elements

---

🎯 Key Idea to Remember

Display controls behavior,
Position controls movement,
Z-index controls layering.
