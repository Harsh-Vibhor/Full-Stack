📘 CSS Module 1 — Introduction (Quick Notes)

1️⃣ What is CSS
• CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
• Used to style and design web pages
• HTML = structure, CSS = appearance

2️⃣ Why CSS is Used
• Adds colors, fonts, spacing, layout
• Makes websites responsive
• Improves UI & user experience
• Without CSS → page looks plain and unorganized

3️⃣ How Browser Uses CSS
• Browser reads HTML → builds structure
• Reads CSS → applies styles
• Combines both → displays webpage
• This process is called rendering

4️⃣ CSS Syntax

selector {
property: value;
}

Example:
p {
color: red;
font-size: 18px;
}

• selector → element to style
• property → what to change
• value → how to change
