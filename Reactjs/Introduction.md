1) What is React?

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UI) for web applications.

It helps us create the UI using small reusable pieces called components.

Simple real-life example:
Think of React like LEGO blocks. Each block is a component, and together they build the whole website.

2) Why is React needed?

React is needed to build fast and interactive websites.

Instead of reloading the whole page when data changes, React updates only the part of the UI that needs to change.

This makes the website:

Faster

Smoother

More user-friendly

Simple real-life example:
If a score changes in a live match app, React updates only the score, not the whole page.

3) What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?

A Single Page Application is a web app that loads only one HTML page and updates content dynamically without reloading the page.

React changes components inside the page instead of loading new pages from the server.

Simple real-life example:
In Gmail, switching between Inbox and Sent Mail does not refresh the page, but the content changes.

If you remember just one flow, remember this:

Data changes → State updates → UI re-renders
