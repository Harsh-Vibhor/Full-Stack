Tags & Elements: Tags are instructions inside angle brackets (e.g., <p>). An element includes the opening tag, content, and closing tag (or self-closes).

Headings (h1–h6): These define heading levels. h1 is the largest/most important, h6 is the smallest/least important.

Paragraph (p): The p tag creates a block of text, separating paragraphs.

Line Break (br): The br tag creates a line break, moving content to the next line.

Strong vs. Em: Strong makes text bold to indicate importance, and Em (emphasis) makes text italic for subtle emphasis. Both highlight meaning.
