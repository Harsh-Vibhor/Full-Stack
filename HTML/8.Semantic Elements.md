What are Semantic Elements?

Semantic elements are HTML tags that describe the meaning of the content, not just how it looks.

They make the webpage:

Easier to read for developers

Better understood by search engines (SEO)

More accessible for screen readers

👉 In short:
Semantic tags tell what the content is, not just how it appears.
