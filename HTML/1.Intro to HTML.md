HTML (HyperText Markup Language): It’s the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content with tags.

Web Page Structure: An HTML page is made up of an “html” element. Inside it, the “head” contains metadata (like the title), and the “body” contains visible content (like headings, paragraphs, images). In summary, HTML structures what you see on a webpage.
