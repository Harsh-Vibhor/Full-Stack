HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, the language used to structure web pages. 
-> It improves on previous versions by introducing semantic elements (like header, footer, article) that describe content more meaningfully. 
-> It also adds native support for audio, video, and graphics (via canvas), along with better form controls and APIs.
-> In short, HTML5 builds a more powerful, multimedia-friendly, and structured web while staying backward compatible.

Doctype: The declaration “<!DOCTYPE html>” appears at the top of the HTML file. It tells the browser to use HTML5 standards.

Basic Structure: The page begins with an html element. Inside, the head section holds metadata (like title), and the body section contains all the visible content. Every HTML5 page follows this structure.
