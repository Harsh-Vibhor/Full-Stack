The basic structure of an HTML page begins with the doctype declaration. Then, the html element wraps everything. 
-> Inside the html element, there’s a head section and a body section. 
-> The head contains metadata—like the page title, links to stylesheets, and other information the browser needs. 
-> The body is where all visible content goes—like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. That’s the foundation of every webpage!
