5) Grouping and Container Elements — Short Notes

div and span ---------

div (division)

A block-level container used to group larger sections of HTML.

Takes full width of the page by default.

Commonly used for layout, sections, and styling with CSS.

span

An inline container used to group small pieces of text or elements.

Does NOT start on a new line.

Mostly used to style specific words or parts of text.

👉 In short:

div → block container for sections

span → inline container for small styling

Note : 
Inline elements only take up as much space as they need for their content, staying in the flow of text. Block-level elements, like divs, expand to fill the entire width of their container, automatically starting on a new line and pushing the next content down. So yes, block-level elements claim the full line, while inline elements just fit in.


ID vs Class Attributes --------

Both are used to identify elements for styling (CSS) or scripting (JS).

id

Unique identifier for ONE element only

Cannot be reused on multiple elements

Used when the element must be uniquely targeted

class

Can be reused on multiple elements

Used for grouping elements with similar styling or behavior

👉 In short:

id → unique (one element)

class → reusable (many elements)
