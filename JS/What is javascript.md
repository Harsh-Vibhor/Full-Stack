📌 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that was invented in 1995 to make websites dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly.

📌 Role of JavaScript

JavaScript allows websites to:

Respond to user actions (clicks, typing, scrolling)

Update content without reloading the page

Create animations, popups, form validation, etc.

📌 Client-Side JavaScript

JavaScript runs inside the web browser

Executed by the browser’s JavaScript engine

Makes web pages interactive instantly

Examples:

Button click actions

Live form validation

Dropdown menus

Dark mode toggles

📌 Server-Side vs Client-Side
Aspect	Client-Side (JavaScript)	Server-Side (PHP / Python)
Runs on	Browser	Server
Speed	Very fast	Depends on network
Page reload	Not required	Often required
Interaction	Immediate	Delayed
📌 Why JavaScript is Important

Reduces unnecessary server requests

Improves user experience

Makes applications feel smooth and responsive

⚠️ Important Reminder

JavaScript today is not limited to browsers — it can also run on servers using Node.js.

📘 Client-side vs Server-side
🖥️ Client-side

Client-side refers to the part of a web application where the code runs inside the user’s web browser. It mainly deals with the user interface and user interactions, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, animations, and instant validations. Client-side code is usually written in JavaScript and helps make websites fast, responsive, and interactive without needing to reload the page every time.

🗄️ Server-side

Server-side refers to the part of a web application where the code runs on the server. It handles important tasks like user authentication, database operations, and business logic. Server-side code processes requests sent by the client and sends back the required data or response. Common server-side languages include Node.js, Python, and PHP.

🔁 How they work together

The client-side sends a request to the server-side, the server processes the request and returns a response, and the client then displays the result to the user.

📌 Example

📝 When you type an email in a login form, client-side JavaScript checks if the format is valid.
🔐 When you click Login, the server-side checks the username and password from the database and sends back a success or error message.

⭐ Key Reminder

👉 Client-side = What the user sees & interacts with
👉 Server-side = How data is processed & stored

2️⃣ What is ECMAScript

ECMAScript (ES) is a standard/specification that defines:

How JavaScript should work

Syntax, rules, keywords, features

JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript.

Examples of ECMAScript features:

let, const

Arrow functions () => {}

Classes

Promises

Modules

ECMAScript is the rulebook, JavaScript follows it.

3️⃣ How Browsers Run JavaScript Internally (Mostly Perfect)


Browsers have a JavaScript Engine

The engine:

Parses JavaScript code

Converts it to machine code

Executes it

Examples of JS Engines:

Chrome → V8

Firefox → SpiderMonkey

Safari → JavaScriptCore

In one line:

Browsers run JavaScript using an embedded JavaScript engine.
